Preheat the #oven up to 350°F (177°C). Line #cakepan with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it’s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.) 

Whisk @packed light or dark brown sugar{3/2%cups}, @granulated sugar{1/2%cup}, @melted butter{1 %cup (240ml)}, @large eggs{4}, @smooth unsweetened applesauce{3/4%cup (180g)}, and @pure vanilla extract{1 %tsp} together in a large bowl until combined and no brown sugar lumps remain. 

In another large bowl, whisk @all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled){3/2 % cups (312g)}, @baking powder{2 %tsps}, @baking soda{1% tsp}, @salt{1/2 %tsp}, @ground cinnamon{3/2 %tsps}, @ground ginger{1% tsp}, @ground nutmeg{1/4% tsp}, and @ground cloves{1/4 %tsp} together. 

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, fold the ingredients together until just combined. Fold in @grated carrots{2 %cups (260g)} (about 4 large).

Pour/spoon the batter evenly into the cake pans. Bake for ~cake{24%minutes}. Test the center with a toothpick. If it comes out clean, the cakes are done. If not, continue to bake until cooked through. Do not over-bake. Allow the cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack.
