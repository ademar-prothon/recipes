### Step 1

Preheat the oven up to 350°F (177°C). Line cakepan with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper.
Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it’s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds
for cakes video & post.)

### Step 2

Whisk packed light or dark brown sugar, granulated sugar, melted butter, large eggs, smooth unsweetened applesauce, and
pure vanilla extract together in a large bowl until combined and no brown sugar lumps remain.

### Step 3

In another large bowl, whisk all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled), baking powder, baking soda, salt, ground cinnamon,
ground ginger, ground nutmeg, and ground cloves together.

### Step 4

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, fold the ingredients
together until just combined. Fold in grated carrots (about 4 large).

### Step 5

Pour/spoon the batter evenly into the cake pans. Bake for 24 minutes. Test the center with a toothpick. If it comes out
clean, the cakes are done. If not, continue to bake until cooked through. Do not over-bake. Allow the cakes to cool
completely in the pans set on a wire rack.
