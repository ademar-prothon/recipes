## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 150Â°C. Place the rack in the center of the oven.

### Step 2

Without peeling them, slice the apples.

### Step 3

Cut the onions in half, then slice them finely.

### Step 4

Place the apples and onions into a Dutch oven (or a roasting pan).

### Step 5

Remove the rind and any visible fat from the fresh pork shoulder roast with bone. Place the roast into the Dutch oven.

### Step 6

In a bowl, using a fork, mix together tomato paste, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, water, chili seasoning, and hot
sauce. Season generously with pepper and add a pinch of salt.

### Step 7

Pour half of the mixture over the pork. Using your hands, coat the meat thoroughly. Turn the pork roasts over and pour
the remaining mixture on top.

### Step 8

Cover and bake in the oven for 3.5 hours, or until the meat shreds easily with a fork.

### Step 9

Let it cool slightly.

### Step 10

Using two forks, shred the meat. Remove the fat and bones. The shredded meat will absorb the sauce.
