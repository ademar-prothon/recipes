Whisk in the egg and egg yolk until combined, then whisk in the pure vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin. Pour into dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and shiny. Step 3 Fold in the semi-sweet chocolate chips. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them. Cover the dough tightly and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days. I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight to prevent overspreading. Step 4 Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. If the dough has chilled for longer than 2 hours, let it sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes. Step 5 Using a cookie scoop or Tablespoon measuring spoon, scoop the chilled cookie dough, about 3 scant Tablespoons (about 2 ounces, or 60g) of dough for XL cookies or 2 heaping Tablespoons (about 1.75 ounces, or 50g) of dough for medium-large cookies. Roll into a ball, then use your fingers to shape the cookie dough so that it\u2019s taller rather than wide\u2014almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker. Repeat with remaining dough. Step 6 Arrange the cookies 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake the cookies for 14 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely. Step 7 While the cookies are still warm, I like to press a few more semi-sweet chocolate chips into the tops\u2014this is optional and only for looks!

Step 2 Pour in the water a little at a time, continuing to stir so that the flour absorbs it and the yeast dissolves completely. Add the salt and pour in the extra virgin olive oil, still mixing. Step 3 This type of roughly mixed dough is called 'no knead'. Step 4 Cover the bowl with a sheet of plastic wrap and let it rise for 30 minutes at room temperature. Step 5 Ideally, place it inside the oven using the 'oven off' function to maintain a steady temperature of 26-28\u00b0C. Step 6 If your oven doesn\u2019t have this feature, you can wrap the bowl in a blanket and keep it in a draft-free spot. Step 7 After this time, transfer the dough to a work surface and fold it over itself, repeating the fold on all four sides. Step 8 Then, three times, stretch the dough toward yourself and fold it back. Step 9 Don\u2019t worry if the dough feels quite sticky at first (you can sprinkle some flour on the surface to help). Step 10 Place the dough back into the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise for another 20 minutes. Step 11 Repeat this folding and resting process two more times; Step 12 on the last round, before placing the dough back into the bowl, drizzle it with a little oil and finally let it rise at room temperature for at least 3 hours. Step 13 Shaping the pizza into pans Step 14 Take the dough, place it on the work surface, and divide it into three equal portions. Step 15 This way, you will get pizzas of the right thickness: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Step 16 (Alternatively, the full amount of dough can be used for one rectangular baking tray.) Step 17 Cover the dough balls with a clean cloth or plastic wrap and let them rise again for another hour at room temperature. Step 18 Sprinkle some semolina flour on the surface and flatten each dough ball by pressing around the edges and the center with your fingers. Step 19 Remove any excess semolina and transfer the dough to a baking tray (26-28 cm), greased with olive oil (it\u2019s okay if the dough doesn\u2019t reach the edges yet). Step 20 Let it rest for about 30 minutes more, then stretch it out to the proper size with your hands. Step 21 Top with tomato sauce and your preferred ingredients. Step 22 Baking the pizza Step 23 Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over the top and bake in a preheated oven at the highest temperature (300\u00b0C) for about 10 minutes, Step 24 or at 200\u00b0\u2013220\u00b0C for 15 minutes. Step 25 You can recreate a stone-baked effect by heating a cast iron baking tray upside down (thicker trays work better) and baking the pizza on top of a sheet of parchment paper.
